# FirstChallenge
repository for PennLPS first challenge
This repository is intended to hold the first challenge for the PennLPS coding bootcamp which consists of HTML and CSS. The code contained inside has had alt's added to it as well as been consolidated where possible to remove redundancy and make the code easier to look at and use. Very little was done to the HTML besides changing class id's, but a lot of code needed to be trimmed out of the CSS to make it more maneagable.
